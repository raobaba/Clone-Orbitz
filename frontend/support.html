                <summary> <b>Refund timelines, policies & processes</b> </summary>
               
                 <p>Due to COVID-19, most refunds for flights, including when they‚Äôre part of a package, are issued within 12 weeks. Some refunds could take a bit longer, depending on the airline.
                    Refunds for hotel, car, or activity, including when they‚Äôre part of a package, are processed within our normal timeframe, 24 hours from the cancellation request. Keep in mind, your bank or payment service determines when the funds become available in your account.
                    
                    In other circumstances not impacted by COVID-19, here‚Äôs what you should know about refund timelines:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How to track your refund</b>
                    <br>
                    Have a refund coming? We‚Äôve made it easy for you to track when it‚Äôll arrive. Click Chat now and our Virtual Agent will guide you to your refund status.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How it works</b>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Orbitz may take up to 24 hours to process your refund. Once that has happened, your bank or payment service (such as PayPal) will take care of the rest. Just know that it may take them up to 7 days to post the credit to your account, and up to 2 billing cycles to show the credit on your statement.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; You‚Äôll see the refund on your original method(s) of payment. So, say you paid using your debit card -- that‚Äôs where the money will be refunded. We‚Äôll send you an email with the nitty-gritty about your refund amount, and how and when you'll get it.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If your credit card statement includes a charge from a third party (such as a low-cost airline, rental car company, or cruise line), you‚Äôll receive your refund from them, not Orbitz. If this is the case, get in touch with that third party to ask any questions about refunds.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you've been charged a deposit or partial payment, you'll be refunded for that amount, minus any fees. Say you paid a USD 200 deposit on your hotel, but you ended up having to cancel. If the hotel charges a USD 20 cancel fee, you‚Äôd get USD 180 back.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The basics on cancellation fees</b>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you used points to pay for your entire booking, and you‚Äôve been charged a cancellation fee, that‚Äôll come out of your points balance.
                    <br>
                    For instance, say you used 1,500 of your 2,000 points to pay for your whole trip. We‚Äôll pretend the cancel fee is USD 20, so that will be converted to points and removed from your remaining 500 points.
                    If you used points and a credit card to pay for your booking, any cancellation fees will come out of the points portion of your refund first, followed by the credit card portion, if necessary.
                    
                    &#8226; If you used all your 2,000 points to pay for your trip, then used your credit card to cover the remaining cost, the cancel fee will come out of your points balance first. So say the fee is USD 20, that means you‚Äôll get 1,980 points put back into your points account.  
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Flights</b>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Did you cancel within 24 hours of making your reservation? Some flight bookings are eligible for a full refund.
                    <br>
                    &#8226;Need to cancel a non-refundable flight? Instead of getting your refund back, you may instead get a flight credit to use for a future booking.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hotels</b>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Most hotels refund all your money if you cancel before their cancellation deadline.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Some hotel rooms are non-refundable, meaning you won‚Äôt get your money back if you cancel.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you cancel a non-refundable hotel booking, or cancel your booking after the hotel's cancellation deadline, you won‚Äôt be able to get a refund, no matter how you paid (using points or your credit card, for instance).
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you canceled before the hotel's cancellation deadline but still see a charge from them on your credit card statement, get in touch with the hotel itself to make sure you get your refund.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Vacation Packages</b>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    &#8226; Within the last 24 hours: You may be able to cancel and get all your money back.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; More than 24 hours ago: Your airline, hotel, car rental company, or activity provider may have a cancellation fee that we‚Äôll pass on to you.

                    &#8226; Does your prepaid car booking qualify for a refund? Check out your itinerary for details. If it does, just know you have to cancel the booking at least 6 hours before pick-up.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Need to return the car early? In this case, you won‚Äôt be refunded for any unused time.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Cruises</b>
                    <br>
                    Most cruise bookings are eligible for a full refund if you cancel up to 90 days before departure.

                    <br>
                    You can get a refund for most activity bookings if you cancel before the activity's cancellation deadline. Just keep in mind that some activities are non-refundable.</p>

                    &#8226; Orbitz may take up to 24 hours to process your refund. Once that has happened, your bank or payment service (such as PayPal) will take care of the rest. Just know that it may take them up to 7 days to post the credit to your account, and up to 2 billing cycles to show the credit on your statement.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; You‚Äôll see the refund on your original method(s) of payment. So, say you paid using your debit card -- that‚Äôs where the money will be refunded. We‚Äôll send you an email with the nitty-gritty about your refund amount, and how and when you'll get it.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If your credit card statement includes a charge from a third party (such as a low-cost airline, rental car company, or cruise line), you‚Äôll receive your refund from them, not Orbitz. If this is the case, get in touch with that third party to ask any questions about refunds.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you've been charged a deposit or partial payment, you'll be refunded for that amount, minus any fees. Say you paid a USD 200 deposit on your hotel, but you ended up having to cancel. If the hotel charges a USD 20 cancel fee, you‚Äôd get USD 180 back.

                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you used points to pay for your entire booking, and you‚Äôve been charged a cancellation fee, that‚Äôll come out of your points balance.
                    <br>
                    For instance, say you used 1,500 of your 2,000 points to pay for your whole trip. We‚Äôll pretend the cancel fee is USD 20, so that will be converted to points and removed from your remaining 500 points.
                    If you used points and a credit card to pay for your booking, any cancellation fees will come out of the points portion of your refund first, followed by the credit card portion, if necessary.
                    
                    &#8226; If you used all your 2,000 points to pay for your trip, then used your credit card to cover the remaining cost, the cancel fee will come out of your points balance first. So say the fee is USD 20, that means you‚Äôll get 1,980 points put back into your points account.

                    Refunds for hotel, car, or activity, including when they‚Äôre part of a package, are processed within our normal timeframe, 24 hours from the cancellation request. Keep in mind, your bank or payment service determines when the funds become available in your account.

                    <b>How it works</b>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Orbitz may take up to 24 hours to process your refund. Once that has happened, your bank or payment service (such as PayPal) will take care of the rest. Just know that it may take them up to 7 days to post the credit to your account, and up to 2 billing cycles to show the credit on your statement.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; You‚Äôll see the refund on your original method(s) of payment. So, say you paid using your debit card -- that‚Äôs where the money will be refunded. We‚Äôll send you an email with the nitty-gritty about your refund amount, and how and when you'll get it.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If your credit card statement includes a charge from a third party (such as a low-cost airline, rental car company, or cruise line), you‚Äôll receive your refund from them, not Orbitz. If this is the case, get in touch with that third party to ask any questions about refunds.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you've been charged a deposit or partial payment, you'll be refunded for that amount, minus any fees. Say you paid a USD 200 deposit on your hotel, but you ended up having to cancel. If the hotel charges a USD 20 cancel fee, you‚Äôd get USD 180 back.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The basics on cancellation fees</b>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you used points to pay for your entire booking, and you‚Äôve been charged a cancellation fee, that‚Äôll come out of your points balance.
                    <br>
                    For instance, say you used 1,500 of your 2,000 points to pay for your whole trip. We‚Äôll pretend the cancel fee is USD 20, so that will be converted to points and removed from your remaining 500 points.
                    If you used points and a credit card to pay for your booking, any cancellation fees will come out of the points portion of your refund first, followed by the credit card portion, if necessary.
                    
                    &#8226; If you used all your 2,000 points to pay for your trip, then used your credit card to cover the remaining cost, the cancel fee will come out of your points balance first. So say the fee is USD 20, that means you‚Äôll get 1,980 points put back into your points account.

                    If you used points and a credit card to pay for your booking, any cancellation fees will come out of the points portion of your refund first, followed by the credit card portion, if necessary.
                    
                    &#8226; If you used all your 2,000 points to pay for your trip, then used your credit card to cover the remaining cost, the cancel fee will come out of your points balance first. So say the fee is USD 20, that means you‚Äôll get 1,980 points put back into your points account.

                    <summary><b>About Unreal Deals and package savings</b></summary>
                     <p>Due to COVID-19, most refunds for flights, including when they‚Äôre part of a package, are issued within 12 weeks. Some refunds could take a bit longer, depending on the airline.
                    Refunds for hotel, car, or activity, including when they‚Äôre part of a package, are processed within our normal timeframe, 24 hours from the cancellation request. Keep in mind, your bank or payment service determines when the funds become available in your account.
                    
                    In other circumstances not impacted by COVID-19, here‚Äôs what you should know about refund timelines:

                    <b>How to track your refund</b>
                    <br>
                    Have a refund coming? We‚Äôve made it easy for you to track when it‚Äôll arrive. Click Chat now and our Virtual Agent will guide you to your refund status.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How it works</b>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; Orbitz may take up to 24 hours to process your refund. Once that has happened, your bank or payment service (such as PayPal) will take care of the rest. Just know that it may take them up to 7 days to post the credit to your account, and up to 2 billing cycles to show the credit on your statement.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; You‚Äôll see the refund on your original method(s) of payment. So, say you paid using your debit card -- that‚Äôs where the money will be refunded. We‚Äôll send you an email with the nitty-gritty about your refund amount, and how and when you'll get it.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If your credit card statement includes a charge from a third party (such as a low-cost airline, rental car company, or cruise line), you‚Äôll receive your refund from them, not Orbitz. If this is the case, get in touch with that third party to ask any questions about refunds.
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you've been charged a deposit or partial payment, you'll be refunded for that amount, minus any fees. Say you paid a USD 200 deposit on your hotel, but you ended up having to cancel. If the hotel charges a USD 20 cancel fee, you‚Äôd get USD 180 back.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The basics on cancellation fees</b>
                    <br>
                    &#8226; If you used points to pay for your entire booking, and you‚Äôve been charged a cancellation fee, that‚Äôll come out of your points balance.
                    <br>
                    For instance, say you used 1,500 of your 2,000 points to pay for your whole trip. We‚Äôll pretend the cancel fee is USD 20, so that will be converted to points and removed from your remaining 500 points.
